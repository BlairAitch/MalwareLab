# Introduction
This is a virtual lab set up using Oracle VirtualBox 6.1.22, the goal is to have a functional malware analysis lab.  The aim of this write-up is not to produce a step-by-step guide to reproduce this lab, just to give an overview of what the lab consists of.

## Network Structure
Our lab will consist of 4 network segments; 
- our Bridged Network which corresponds to the local network used at home, this is the network our hypervisor is on;
- the Management Network (172.16.1.0/24) which our hypervisor host will have a direct connection to using a virtual network card attached to our host machine, this where weâ€™ll manage most of the VMs in our lab from;
- the IPS1 and IPS2 segments which share a range (172.16.2.0/24) and are connected through an AFPACKET bridge supplied by our IPS VM, this allows us to quarantine the IPS2 segment at will by either killing the IPS VM or killing the Snort service running on it.
